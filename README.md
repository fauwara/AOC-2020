## [**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about)

>This repository contains all my solutions for the Advent of code Challenges

## Why start this challenge?
- I'm a lazy person, challenges like these get motivated to code/learn when I'm not the only one doing it.
- Keeps me consistent in solving problems every day throughout the challenge and hopefully after the challenge as well.
- Have fun and vibe with the other people doing the challenge. ðŸ™Œ

## The Repo
- Each problem statement has its own folder which mostly contains its README.md, an input file, and index.py.
