# [Problem Statement](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1)

> I have trimmed out only the important parts of the problem statements. The complete problem statement can be found in the header above.

## Part - 1

Specifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to `2020` and then multiply those two numbers together.

For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:

```
1721
979
366
299
675
1456
```

- In this list, the two entries that sum to `2020` are `1721` and `299`. Multiplying them together produces `1721 * 299 = 514579`, so the correct answer is `514579`.

## Part - 2
> The second part will be unlocked once you solve the first part in the website.

- Using the above example again, the three entries that sum to `2020` are `979`, `366`, and `675`. Multiplying them together produces the answer, `241861950`.

In your expense report, what is the product of the three entries that sum to 2020?
